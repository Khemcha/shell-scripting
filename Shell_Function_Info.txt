# FUNCTION USAGE AND SYNTAX
We can create functions to perform tasks and we can also create functions that take
parameters (also called arguments) as you can see in the following steps:
1.) A function can be defined as follows:
   function fname()
    {
      statements;
    }
   Or alternately,
   fname()
   {
    statements;
   }

2.) A function can be invoked just by using its name:
$ fname ; # executes function

3.) Arguments can be passed to functions and can be accessed by our script:
fname arg1 arg2 ; # passing args
Following is the definition of the function fname. In the fname function, we have
included various ways of accessing the function arguments.
fname()
{
 echo $1, $2; #Accessing arg1 and arg2
 echo "$@"; # Printing all arguments as list at once
 echo "$*"; # Similar to $@, but arguments taken as single entity
 return 0; # Return value
}
